In this project, we utilize publicly available datasets containing both parasitized and infected cell images. The primary dataset comes from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and has been made accessible through Kaggle under the title Malaria Cell Images Dataset. It consists of 27,558 labeled images divided into two equal classes: 13,779 images of parasitized cells and 13,779 images of uninfected cells. Each image is a microscopic snapshot of a thin blood smear, stained to highlight the presence of Plasmodium parasites, which are the organisms responsible for causing malaria.
